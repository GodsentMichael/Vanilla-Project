    <p>
      Vanilla group is one amongst the many groups formed within AltSchool Africa, to carry out the Holiday Project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many other groups within AltSchool, Vanilla group is made up of more than 6 persons who cut across the
      different tracks; FrontEnd, BackEnd and Cloud Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this special group is special because it doesn't follow the traditional AltSchool grouping which
      categorizes students in circles, rather Vanilla group is more like an offshoot of different persons from different
      circles whose circle members might
      have been inactive or non-responsive hence prompting them to seek out other groups.
    </p>
    <h2>Is the group legal?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, don't fret, Vanilla group is totally legal, your concerns as to why the group might not be legal is
      understandable. Owing to Our Instructor
      <em>Jerry Uke</em> giving room for some persons to join other groups mainly on the basis that their original
      circle
      was inactive or not cordinated. On such grounds Vanilla group is fully legal and authorized to fly as an adhoc
      group.
